# NoteFlow
an app created for my sem V cloud computing and virtualisation class mini project. a basic app where multiple users can post messages and delete them with light and dark mode functionality.
lightweight, real-time note-sharing web app. users can post and delete text-based notes in a chat-style interface. built with firebase for database storage and hosting, demonstrating dynamic data syncing and responsive front-end design.
