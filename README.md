# NoteFlow

An app created for my Sem V Cloud Computing and Virtualisation class mini project. A basic app where multiple users can post messages and delete them with light and dark mode functionality.

Lightweight, real-time note-sharing web app. Users can post and delete text-based notes in a chat-style interface. Built with Firebase for database storage and hosting, demonstrating dynamic data syncing and responsive front-end design.
